# Nixus: Experimental deployment tool for multiple NixOS systems

This is a work-in-progress deployment tool I'm developing for myself and [Niteo](https://niteo.co/). Noteworthy features include:

- Auto-rollback if the machine can't be reached via SSH anymore, protecting against a number of configuration mistakes such as
  - Messing up the network config
  - Removing your SSH key from the authorized keys
  - The activation script failing in any way
  - The boot activation failing in any way
  - The system crashing during the deployment
- Multi-host abstraction modules, such as:
  - An [SSH access module](./modules/ssh.nix), allowing you to configure secure SSH access between machines
  - More to follow..
- Secret management
- More coming..

## How to use it

Note: This is just to demonstrate, this will probably change in the future

Write a file like `example/default.nix`, then build the deployment script and call it
```
$ nix-build example/default.nix
these derivations will be built:
